DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The man‚Äê
       ual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to  look  only
       in  that  section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see
       DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.
